# Askul Quote Converter (pdf to excel)

This Python script is my first attempt at learning how to code in Python.

It is tailored to convert a "quote.pdf" file downloaded from the Askul site into an Excel file. It then performs various data manipulations, including removing backslashes from cells, deleting specific columns and rows, applying regex replacements to certain columns, and adding a SUM formula to calculate totals. Specifically, the SUM formula is applied to column "I5" to calculate the total without tax based on the item price and quantity. The script is designed to be run directly, and it's particularly useful for processing Askul quotes, providing a structured Excel output and an accurate total without tax for the items based on their price and quantity.
